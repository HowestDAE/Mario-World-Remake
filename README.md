<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Alt text](DAE28_lennert_saerens/Resources/MarioWorld.png)

Here's why:
* I'm a pretty big mario fan and i like 2D platformers in general.
* I chose this over the first mario game because it introduces more new features so it won't be too easy for me to make.
* A lot of the things this game has will make me more used to programming in general i think.

## My version

This section gives a clear and detailed overview of which parts of the original game I planned to make.

### The minimum I will most certainly develop:
* All the movement of mario. 
* All of the enemys in the levels i will make.
* The ability to pick up power-ups.
* The ability to defeat enemys.
* The first level of the game.

### What I will probably make as well:
* A few more levels that i think are interesting.
* More enemy types.

### What I plan to create if I have enough time left:
* The whole of world 1 
* A world map

<!-- CLASS STRUCTURE -->
## Class structure 

### Object composition 
I have used object composition for the fireballs that are shot by mario;

### Inheritance 
Inheritance is used for all enemy types, they all inherit from one enemy class.
Inhertitance is also udes for the blocks, the question mark block is inherited from the normal block.
The dragon coin inherits from the basic coin.

### Agregation
Agregation is used for the managers: Enemy manager, texture manager and sound manager. They are used in multiple instances of the level class.

### Association
Association is not used
